# Balance and Transactions API

### `GET /balances` 

This endpoint returns what was the balance of the customer on a specific date.
For example:  

```json
{ 
	"amount": 10000, 
	"currency": "EUR", 
	"date": "2022-06-30T23:59:59.577Z" 
}
```

This means, the user had 100 Eur in their bank account on 30/06/2022.
Bear in mind that all amounts are in cents, so `1 Euro` is represented as `100`.
You should assume that today is `30/06/2022`.

### `GET /transactions`

This is going to return a list of all past transactions done by that customer:

```json
{ 
	"transactions": [ 
		{ 
			"amount": -765, 
			"currency": "EUR", 
			"date": "2022-02-07T09:57:27.235Z", 
			"status": "BOOKED" 
		}, 
		{ 
			"amount": -911, 
			"currency": "EUR", 
			"date": "2022-01-03T22:00:09.002Z", 
			"status": "PROCESSED" 
		}, 
        ...
	] 
} 
```

### `GET /historical-balances?from=2022-01-01&to=2022-01-10&sort=desc`
```json
[
    {
        "date": "10/01/2022",
        "amount": 7872,
        "currency": "EUR"
    },
    {
        "date": "09/01/2022",

        "amount": 9571,
        "currency": "EUR"
    },
    {
        "date": "02/01/2022",
        "amount": 9599,
        "currency": "EUR"
    },
    {
        "date": "01/01/2022",
